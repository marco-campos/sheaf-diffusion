# Sheaf Diffusion Simulation on Graphs

This project implements the sheaf diffusion process described in **Section 5** of the paper [*Opinion Dynamics on Discourse Sheaves*](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/20M1341088) by Hansen and Ghrist. The primary goal is to visualize how opinions evolve over time using diffusion dynamics on sheaves defined over a graph. This implementation uses a custom sheaf Laplacian, simulates the diffusion process, and provides tools to animate and visualize the opinion dynamics as the diffusion evolves.

## Project Overview

### 1. **Sheaf Laplacian Construction**
- The sheaf Laplacian $L_F$ is computed using the *coboundary* matrix (denoted as $ \delta$) obtained from the node and edge vector spaces and the corresponding connecting maps.
- Each node and edge in the graph has an associated vector space, and the connecting maps define the linear transformations between these vector spaces.
- For a given graph, the sheaf Laplacian is calculated as:
    
    $$ L_F = \delta^T \delta $$

  where $ \delta $ is a matrix built based on the given graph structure and connecting maps.

### 2. **Diffusion Process Simulation**
- The project simulates the diffusion process governed by the differential equation:

  $$\frac{dx}{dt} = -\alpha L_F x $$

  The exact solution to this equation is given by:

  $$ x(t) = \exp(-t\alpha L_F) x(0)$$

  where $\alpha > 0 $ is a diffusion constant and $ x(0) $ is the initial opinion vector.

- A numerical simulation is performed using explicit Euler time-stepping to approximate the solution over time. The final solution $ x(t) $ as $ t \rightarrow \infty $ is compared to the orthogonal projection of the initial opinion vector onto the kernel of the sheaf Laplacian.

### 3. **Visualization and Animation**
- For graphs where the vector spaces have dimension at most 2, the project provides visualizations for the evolving dynamics:
  - **1D Vector Spaces**: Use grayscale intensity to represent node and edge values.
  - **2D Vector Spaces**: Use RGB color maps to visualize the evolution of opinions on the graph.
- The tool includes a function to generate an animated video of the diffusion process, allowing users to observe how opinions evolve over time.

## File Structure

- **`sheaf_diffusion.py`**: Contains the implementation of the `SheafDiffusion` class, which constructs the sheaf Laplacian and simulates the diffusion dynamics.
- **`sheaf_visualization.py`**: Contains the `SheafDiffusionVisualizer` class for plotting and animating the diffusion process.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation and overview.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the dependencies required to run the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Required packages listed in `requirements.txt`. Install using:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Running the Project

1. **Construct the Graph and Define Vector Spaces**:
   Define the graph structure, node vector spaces, edge vector spaces, and connecting maps. Hereâ€™s an example setup with the picture of the sheaf we are generating below:

   ```python
   graph_structure = {'e1': ('v1', 'v2'), 'e2': ('v2', 'v3'), 'e3': ('v3', 'v4'), 'e4': ('v4', 'v1')}
   node_spaces = {'v1': 1, 'v2': 2, 'v3': 1, 'v4': 2}
   edge_spaces = {'e1': 1, 'e2': 1, 'e3': 1, 'e4': 2}
   connecting_maps = {
       'e1': (np.array([[-2]]), np.array([[-1, 2]])),
       'e2': (np.array([[1, 1]]), np.array([[1]])),
       'e3': (np.array([[-1]]), np.array([[1, -1]])),
       'e4': (np.array([[1, -1], [1, 0]]), np.array([[1], [0]]))
   }
   ```

2. **Initialize the Sheaf Diffusion**:
   Create a `SheafDiffusion` instance:

   ```python
   sheaf_diffusion = SheafDiffusion(graph_structure, node_spaces, edge_spaces, connecting_maps)
   ```

3. **Run the Diffusion Process**:
   Specify the initial condition and run the diffusion simulation:

   ```python
   initial_condition = [np.array([1]), np.array([0, 1]), np.array([0]), np.array([1, -1])]
   _, all_states = sheaf_diffusion.run_diffusion(initial_condition, alpha=0.1, dt=0.01, num_timesteps=100)
   ```

4. **Visualize and Animate**:
   Create a `SheafDiffusionVisualizer` instance and generate a video:

   ```python
   visualizer = SheafDiffusionVisualizer(sheaf_diffusion, graph_structure)
   visualizer.animate_diffusion(all_states, filename="sheaf_diffusion.mp4", interval=50)
   ```

## Features

1. **Numerical and Analytical Solutions**:
   - Compares the numerical solution from time-stepping to the analytical solution using matrix exponentiation.
   
2. **Kernel Projection**:
   - Computes the kernel of the sheaf Laplacian and projects the initial condition onto the kernel.
   
3. **Visualization**:
   - Provides 1D and 2D visualizations using grayscale and RGB color maps.

4. **Animation**:
   - Generates an animated video showing how opinions evolve on the graph over time.
